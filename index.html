        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of the game is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile
          with the number 2048.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting Grid:</strong> The game begins with a 4x4 grid populated with two tiles, each with a value
          of either 2 or 4.</li>
        <li><strong>Tile Movement:</strong> You can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. You do
          this by swiping on a touchscreen device or using the arrow keys on a keyboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Tile Combining:</strong> When you move tiles in a certain direction, they all slide as far as
          possible in that direction until they hit the edge of the grid or another tile. If two tiles with the same
          number collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.</li>
        <li><strong>New Tile Generation:</strong> After each move, a new tile appears in an empty spot on the grid. The
          value of the new tile is randomly selected to be either 2 or 4.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Over:</strong> The game ends when there are no more empty spaces on the grid and no more
          possible moves to make. This occurs when the grid is completely filled with tiles and no adjacent tiles have
          the same value.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Your score increases with each merge you make. The value of the merged tile is
          added to your score. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest score possible before the game ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> To succeed in 2048, you need to plan your moves carefully and think ahead. Try to
          create larger tiles by merging smaller ones and keep the grid as open as possible to make room for new tiles.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> 2048 requires patience and persistence. Don't get discouraged if you don't
          reach 2048 on your first try. Keep practicing and refining your strategy to improve your chances of success.
        </li>
